Analysis workflows of Master thesis "Detection and evaluation of maize conserved noncoding sequences inferred using comparative genomics"

The analysis workflows and pipelines of this thesis consist of three parts:
- Characterization of version 4 and 5 maize assemblies + testing of coordinate conversion methods
- The BLSSpeller pipeline: generating the required input and processing the BLSSpeller output for evaluation and parameter tuning
- Comparison of different phylogenetic footprinting methods

For each part, pipelines and workflows are given for each step in the analysis.
