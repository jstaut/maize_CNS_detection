The buckler CNS set corresponds to the CNS set described by Song et al. (2021). The data was downloaded from https://genome.cshlp.org/content/suppl/2021/06/22/gr.266528.120.DC1

The pan CNS set was derived by concatenating the pairwise CNS regions and then sorting and merging using bedtools. The core CNS set was generated by intersecting the pairwise CNS sets with bedtools intersect.

Coordinates were converted from V4 to V5 using the liftOver tool with chain file available at https://download.maizegdb.org/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0/chain_files/B73_RefGen_v4_to_Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0.chain
